<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>A group of Supernatural Investigators (SpIn for short) have been tasked with looking into a haunted mansion. You, codenamed Red, must decide whether unraveling the mystery of this mansion is worth potentially losing the comrades that have come with you.</p>
    <p>This is a Visual Novel created in Ren'Py. The original storyboard can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ceU-0Q_gvzjJj_llSAPQmxrfVv0lbiWf/view?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Main Features/Gameplay</h3>
<p>This game is a Visual Novel. This means that it is heavily focused on the story it tells through text and sprites. However, unlike most Visual Novel, SpIn has two "Modes" aside from the Story Mode.</p>
    <p><strong>Hunt Mode</strong><br/>
        In this mode, players can "examine" a given area to find spirits and other creatures hidden. Finding these creatures give you various energy to become fuel for the Battle Mode. In a very lucky case, player will be able to find a Chest filled with energy.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Battle Mode</strong><br/>
        In this mode, players will fight the boss of the area using the energy collected through the Hunt Mode. It is your typical rpg-style battle with the ability to attack, defend, use magic, use "beast" mode, and heal. Each of these abilities cost energy (or jewels, in the case of heal). Although attack, defend, and use magic are standard, the "beast" mode is there to give the players an extra boost in power should they need it against the enemy. Each enemy have a different fighting style that changes depending on the situation such as low hp or the location that they're in. 
    </p>

<h3>User Interfaces & Controls</h3>
<p>The user interface is a very simple system that relies on the functionality of Ren'Py. The players mainly use the mouse to click through the story and play through the different modes of this game. There is one keyboard input at the beginning of the game to pick a name for the player.</p>

<h3>Main Difficulties/Challenges</h3>
<p>Originally, instead of Hunt Mode, I wanted to have "Shoot" Mode. The ghosts and creatures will appear on the right side of the screen and the player had to "shoot" them down before they got too close to the player sprite on the left side of the screen within a time limit. Unfortunately, this functionality is not something that Ren'Py could easily do, possibly due to my own lack of knowledge and wish to use imagebuttons. Every time any of the ghost or creature were clicked, the entire screen will reset, which defeated the purpose of this shooting mini-game. Thus, I had no choice but to scrap it in favor of a more "investigation" style idea that I had but couldn't come up with a story-related idea to use. This is why I have the Hunt Mode instead of the Shoot Mode.</p>
    <p>Another difficulty that I ran into was that I have actually never programmed in Python nor with Ren'Py before this game. I knew the theory behind Python (as I did try to tutor someone in Python without knowing anything of it and it ended with that person failing that class), but I have always been more comfortable with C variants and java. On top of that, I have always created games in Unity, so to switch not only the language but also the software used caused some confusion and a lot of frustration on my end. Debugging was another problem that was headache-inducing. Simple things that sounded sane in my head ended up breaking the game such as "i++" vs "i+=1." Furthermore, Ren'Py's customization relied heavily on special Ren'Py scripting language that was very similiar to CSS. It wasn't hard to learn, but it did give me a minor panic attack when I saw the clumps of code for the first time.</p>
    <p>This one is bit of a minor difficulty, but I did struggle with getting the AIs to perform the way I want them to in the Battle Mode. Setting up the RPG style fight wasn't as hard as I feared it would be (making it look good, though, was a different story). But programming the AIs were tricky because I had to not only think of what would be fun to fight against, but also consider whether it was feasible for people to win with the given tools. Then there was the story-related AI movements to consider. For example, the Butler is the only enemy who can call upon other "puppets" to fight against you because he's the Head Butler who can command other butlers and maids. Thus, when he summons those puppets, there's a sound of a ding of a "request for service." Another example of this is in one of the final battle against the Witch, as long as you're in the special dark room, she will not attack you and just defend herself. This is because she doesn't want you to destroy anything in that room. Although thinking of these kinds of reasons were fun, it wasn't as easy to program.</p>
    <p>On a non-technical aspect of difficulties, I struggled with the three art programs that I used. The art program I typically use is MediBang Paint, which is a free software that has a cloud service so that I can work on the pictures on the go. It has a photoshop export function, which I used to add filters for the backgrounds. In the middle of working on this, FireAlpaca (another free, light-weight software) announced their updates to their 3D drawing function. But because I don't have any of my brushes saved for Firealpaca, it made creating those pictures difficult at times. Especially since I had to continuously pass the file between the three program to get the result I wanted, and even then, it doesn't look good enough.</p>
    <p>Lastly, I ran into quite a writer's block as I was working on the story. The storyline for SpIn is something that I have been working on for probably a year or so before this project. I knew in theory how the story was going to wrap-up and all the little details I wanted to mention. But because the original idea was a jrpg-style horror game and not a visual novel format, I had to change a lot of little things around for it to make sense. Furthermore, despite having the entire story mapped out in my head, I had a hard time getting the words down on the page. Made worse by the fact that for every new location in the story, I needed a new background, which made me reluctant to add more to the story.</p>
    
<h3>Future Plans</h3>
<p>The biggest thing that I would like to do is to finish the story by adding Rookie's and Blue's routes. After that, I'd like to finally put together the "True End" route, which finally explains more about the Mansion and all the people within it. Once all the story is finished, I'd like to finally give the main three boys extra sprites. For the sake of the mood (and for the final fight), I went ahead and gave different emotional sprites for the enemy, but Rookie, Blue, and Green are all static. That seems quite unfair. Of course, once I add all the sprites, then it'll be time for actual CGs. Typically, this is the most rewarding thing a visual novel player can recieve. So the fact that I only have one at the beginning of SpIn is not only ridiculous, but also insulting.</p>
    <p>Once all the visual novel aspect of SpIn is done, I'd reall like to add some extras. For one, I'd love to have a Gallery of all the CGs, Music, and Endings. And to clean up and add the previously discarded Shoot Mode as a mini-game that you can unlock once you've cleared one of the routes. Of course, once you clear the True End, you'd be able to access Bonus Content such as some sketches of original concept ideas, skits, and a heartfelt gratitude from me.</p>

    <h3>Credits</h3>
    <p> Story was written and coded by me with the help of Ren'Py. The sprites and backgrounds were all me, too. They were created through combining the powers of Photoshop CC, MediBang Paint, and FireAlpaca. The special effect sound and music, however, were borrowed from these talented people.</p>
